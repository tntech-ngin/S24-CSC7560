Paper 1 Paper 1: AI/ML-based real-time classification of Software Defined Networking traffic Link Speaker: Yoshi Slides Questions: Q1: In section 3.3 what does delta packets, instant bytes per seconds and instant packets per second features mean? Q2: What are the preprocessing steps in this study? Q3: What are the applications/benefits of categorizing the traffic? Q4: How do the Machine Learning algorithms compare with state-of-the-art traditional algorithms for SDN traffic classification? Q5: what are the tradeoffs to each of the supervised learning algorithms and how to they apply to a specific network scenario? Q6: Is it real- time? How can we measure that it is actual real-time? Q7: The data was divided into four categories, but is there any indication of what most influenced those categories? Q8: Does the report offer any explanation for the telnet misclassifying for the LR and Naive Bayes and/or did they offer any insight on what could be improved upon for better results?

Paper 2 Predicting Future Traffic using Hidden Markov Models Link Speaker: Jestus Slides Questions: Q1: Predicting Future Traffic using Hidden Markov Models - What is the extent of the state the Markov State is encapsulating? Paper 3	Flow-based Throughput Prediction using Deep Learning and Real-World Network Traffic Link Speaker: Nick Slides Questions: Q1: Given that the paper tries to predict bit rate of network traffic flow, I\u0026rsquo;d like to understand why this is treated as a classification task and not as a regression task. What are the advantages to this approach? Traffic Classification #Thursday, Mar 7:
Paper 4 Resource Management with Deep Reinforcement Learning Link Speaker: Rajat Slides Questions: Is it possible to apply this approach for non-preemptive scheduling? Is it possible to use this approach for real-time jobs since it is based on reinforcement learning and learn online from environment? What are the computational and resource requirements for training and deploying the DeepRM model in a real-world cluster environment, and how do they scale with the size and complexity of the cluster and workload? What are some potential problems that can arise if Deep RN were to be deployed on a real-world network instead of a pre-constructed network for it to train? What is the difference between Completion Time (Cj) and duration (Tj) of the job? How does DeepRM handle scenarios where resources are dynamically changing or where resource demands fluctuate over time? Is there any indication in this paper of issues scaling this trained network into a larger system? What is are the anticipated impacts of the model not considering the longest lasting flows (those greater than 5mins)? I would think these would have the highest impact on resources utilization. How can we leverage Deep RL techniques to automatically learn efficient resource management in complex computer systems and networks? Paper 5 Selecting critical features for data classification based on machine learning methods Link Speaker: Xi Slides Questions: What are Po and Pe in equation 9? How much do the feature selections depend on model trying to predict? Can we combine feature selection methods based on the model we want to preprocess for better performance? Considering the significant variation in accuracy observed across different feature selection methods (RF, RFE, Boruta) and classifier algorithms (RF, SVM, KNN, LDA), what can we infer, and when would an algorithm be preferred in a real-world scenario? Is the importance of features derived from machine learning algorithms consistent across all target classes of classification task? Some features can be more important for predicting one class than another. What impact does this have on the feature selection process? compare both binary classification and multi-class classification, what are the advantages of using multi-class classification? Can the feature selection methods handle imbalanced datasets effectively? Selecting critical features for data classification based on machine learning methods: What peculiarities of the dataset might have influenced the performance of one methodology or another? Is there ever a time to use the lower preforming algorithms ? The paper assumes that the relationship between flow counts and traffic volumes, modeled by the transition and emission probabilities in the HMM, does it remain stationary over time?
