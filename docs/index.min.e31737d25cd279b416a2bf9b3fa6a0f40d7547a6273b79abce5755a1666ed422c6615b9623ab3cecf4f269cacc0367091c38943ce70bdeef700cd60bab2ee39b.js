Paper 1 Paper 1: AI/ML-based real-time classification of Software Defined Networking traffic Link Speaker: Yoshi Slides Questions: Q1: In section 3.3 what does delta packets, instant bytes per seconds and instant packets per second features mean? Q2: What are the preprocessing steps in this study? Q3: What are the applications/benefits of categorizing the traffic? Q4: How do the Machine Learning algorithms compare with state-of-the-art traditional algorithms for SDN traffic classification? Q5: what are the tradeoffs to each of the supervised learning algorithms and how to they apply to a specific network scenario? Q6: Is it real- time? How can we measure that it is actual real-time? Q7: The data was divided into four categories, but is there any indication of what most influenced those categories? Q8: Does the report offer any explanation for the telnet misclassifying for the LR and Naive Bayes and/or did they offer any insight on what could be improved upon for better results?

Paper 2 Predicting Future Traffic using Hidden Markov Models Link Speaker: Jestus Slides Questions: Q1: Predicting Future Traffic using Hidden Markov Models - What is the extent of the state the Markov State is encapsulating? Paper 3	Flow-based Throughput Prediction using Deep Learning and Real-World Network Traffic Link Speaker: Nick Slides Questions: Q1: Given that the paper tries to predict bit rate of network traffic flow, I\u0026rsquo;d like to understand why this is treated as a classification task and not as a regression task. What are the advantages to this approach? Traffic Classification #Thursday, Mar 7:
